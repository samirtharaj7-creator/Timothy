Deploys to `https://timothy.mybibleexplorer.com` through GitHub Pages on every push to `main` (see `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`). One-time setup: create the GitHub repository, set Pages to "GitHub Actions", add the custom domain, and add a DNS CNAME record `timothy` → `samirtharaj7-creator.github.io`.
